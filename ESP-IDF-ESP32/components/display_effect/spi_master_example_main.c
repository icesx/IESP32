/*
 This code displays some fancy graphics on the 320x240 LCD on an ESP-WROVER_KIT board.
 This example demonstrates the use of both spi_device_transmit as well as
 spi_device_queue_trans/spi_device_get_trans_result and pre-transmit callbacks.

 Some info about the ILI9341/ST7789V: It has an C/D line, which is connected to a GPIO here. It expects this
 line to be low for a command and high for data. We use a pre-transmit callback here to control that
 line: every transaction has as the user-definable argument the needed state of the D/C line and just
 before the transaction is sent, the callback will set this line to the correct state.
